~chst~ is a personal project and as such is designed to fulfil my needs.
That being said, ~chst~ is a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document-oriented_database][document store]] tool based on [[https://www.sqlite.org/index.html][sqlite]]. I am well aware there are projects that already do that, but for my needs they have too many features. I just want to have a database file in my ~/user/home/~ and a tool that can store documents inside and retrieve them when needed.
Of course I don't want to waste space so they get compressed before being committed to the database.
